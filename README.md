# Grenades a Dozen -- an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod
Grenades a Dozen is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds multiple type of throwable grenades and explosives. Like my gun addons, NZGE and Redundant Guns, Grenades a Dozen expands the selection of grenades available in CGM, with new types of grenades and variants of existing grenades.
