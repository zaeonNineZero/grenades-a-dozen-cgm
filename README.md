# Grenades a Dozen -- an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod
Grenades a Dozen is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod by An0m3L1 and zaeonNineZero that adds multiple type of throwable grenades and explosives. Similar in vein to NineZero's Gun Expansion, Grenades a Dozen expands the selection of grenades available in CGM.

So far this addon only adds a Smoke Grenade, with plans for a few more types of grenades before its official release.
