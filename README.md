# Grenades a Dozen -- an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod
Grenades a Dozen is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod by An0m3L1 and zaeonNineZero that adds additional types of throwable grenades. Similar in vein to NineZero's Gun Expansion, Grenades a Dozen expands the selection of grenades available in CGM, giving you more ways to confront enemies and hold ground.

### Addon Features:
* Five new grenades, including smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, molotovs, impact grenades, and high-explosive grenades.
* Smoke grenades emit obstructive smoke particles and apply a visual effect to players who enter the smoke cloud.
* Incendiary grenades and molotovs light blocks on fire! The molotov ignites on impact while the incendiary grenade has a fuse.
* All grenades can have their properties changed via the common configuration file. Feel free to make adjustments!
* Crafting recipes for all grenades, allowing them to be used in survival mode.
