# Grenades a Dozen -- an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod
Grenades a Dozen is an addon for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod that adds multiple type of throwable grenades and explosives. Similar in vein to NineZero's Gun Expansion, Grenades a Dozen expands the selection of grenades available in CGM, with new types of grenades and variants of existing grenades.

Special thanks to An0m3L1 for their work in creating new grenade types for CGM!
